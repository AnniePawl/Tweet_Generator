# Tweet Generator
## Game Plan
1. Use python script to randomly generate words from a dictionary
2. Build sentences by sampling these words using a Markov language model
3. Implement grammar rules parsed from the text of a large document set
4. Build data structures to store words and sentences, including:</br>
    - Linked Lists
    - Hash Tables
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Heaps
5. Analyze inner workings and performance tradeoffs of each data structure
6. Deploy language model to a Flask web server on Heroku and connect it to Twitter

## Learning Outcomes
- Write python programs that can run as scripts and imported as modules
- read and write text files stored on a disk, manipulate strings, and parse into words
- build web apps with Flask framework and deploy to web using heroku
- construct and sample probability distributions based on observed work frequencies
- create Markov language models, use them to generate new sentences
- write library code organized into separate independent modules with low coupling
- run unit tests that assert functions and classes wxhibit the correct behavior
- implement core data structures
- analyze complexity of iterative algorithm performance
- benchmark data structure and algorithm performance
- use regular expressions to parse and clean up text and tokenize words and sentences
