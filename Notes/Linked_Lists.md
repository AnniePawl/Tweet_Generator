# Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object
    - Link list objects are not stored in contiguous order
    - A collection nodes, which together represent a sequence
    - Each node contains data and a reference (a link)
    - Each element points to the next
    - Entry point is called "head"
    - Last node is called "tail"


### Benefits
- Structure allows efficient insertion and removal of elements from any position in the sequence
- Dynamic size
- Overflow can't happen unless memory is actually full
- Moving pointers in easy

### Drawbacks
- Access time is linear, sequential from first node
- No random access
- Pointers take up space
- Not cache friendly
# Types of Linked Lists
**Singly Linked List:** Described above. Operations that can be performed on a single linked list include *insertion, deletion and traversal* </br>
**Doubly Linked List:** Has two references, one to next node and one to previous node.
